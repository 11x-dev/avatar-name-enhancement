# Development Environment

Getting setup is easy, you'll need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed,
then simply clone the repository and within the working directory run the following:

```
# You only need to run this the first time
sudo npm install -g yarn
yarn install

# Run this to start the development server and build system
npm run dev
```

If you're on linux, you can simply type `make` and it will do all this for you as well.

Once running, you can then navigate to [http://dev.beta.online-go.com:8080/](http://dev.beta.online-go.com:8080/)
which loads the interface from your local server that you just started with gulp, and 
connects to the beta server for testing.
